## Design ideas

  * the leaf is inspired by the leaf on the Spring logo
  * the cog silhouette is inspired by the cogs on the GeoExt logo
  * the color of the leaf is the color of the darker part on the top most layer
    of the OpenLayers logo
  * the small circle (the inner part of the cog) can also be interpreted as a
    globe; adding the geo-connection
