title.onlyUseStableBuildsAsReference=Only use stable builds as reference
description.onlyUseStableBuildsAsReference=Use the last stable build as the reference to compute the number of new \
                   warnings against. This allows to ignore interim unstable builds for which the number of warnings \
                   decreased. Note that the last stable build is evaluated only by inspecting the unit test failures. \
                   The static analysis results are not considered.
title.usePreviousBuildAsReference=Use previous build as reference
description.usePreviousBuildAsReference=If set the number of new warnings will always be computed based on the \
                   previous build, even if that build is unstable (due to a violated warning threshold). \
                   Otherwise the last build that did not violate any \
                   given threshold will be used as reference. It is recommended to uncheck this option if \
                   the plug-in should ensure that all new warnings will be finally fixed in subsequent builds.
description.status.total=If the number of total warnings is greater than one of these thresholds then a build is \
                   considered as unstable or failed, respectively. I.e., a value of 0 means that the build status is \
                   changed if there is at least one warning found. \
                   Leave this field empty if the state of the build should not depend on the number of warnings.
title.status.total=Status thresholds (Totals)
description.status.new=If the specified number of new warnings exceeds one of these thresholds then a build is \
                   considered as unstable or failed, respectively. I.e., a value of 0 means that the build status is \
                   changed if there is at least one new warning found. \
                   Leave this field empty if the state of the build should not depend on the number of new warnings.
title.status.new=Status thresholds (New warnings)
description.filter=Filter all issues with the specified set of filters. \
                   If no filter is given, all issues will be published.
title.sourceCodeEncoding=Source Code Encoding
description.sourceCodeEncoding=Encoding of your source code. \
    Leave this field empty to use the default encoding of the platform.
description.name=Display name of the tool. This name is used in details views, trend captions, and hyper links. \
  The built-in default name of the registered tool (see above) will be used if this field is left empty.
description.id=ID of this tool, it must be unique and must not be already used by another tool in this job. \
  This ID is used as link to the results, so choose a short and meaningful name. \
  The built-in default ID of the registered tool (see above) will be used if this field is left empty.
