    <h2>Argument Propagation Mutator (ARGUMENT_PROPAGATION)</h2>

    <p>If a method has a parameter whose type matches the return type, this
        operator replaces the actual return value with the value of the parameter.
        Hence it is only applicable to non-void methods.
        For example:</p>

 <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
   public String aMethod() {
     String aValue = "example";
     return bMethod(aValue);
   }

   private String bMethod(String param) {
     return param + " not mutated";
   }
 </pre>

    is mutated to

 <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
   public String mutatedMethod() {
     String aValue = "example";
     return aValue;
   }
 </pre>
    <p>see <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#ARGUMENT_PROPAGATION">Pitest Mutators</a></p>
