Questions & Answes
==================

Q: Will there be a commercial version of Pitest as well?
---
A: No. It's a community project and it should stay that way. 

Q: Why a commercial plugin at all?
---
A: The community plugin covers some basic pitest support and may suit more needs. However it still requires the mutation
coverage reports to get the actual details of the mutation. This might be ok for small teams. Larger enterprises with
distributed teams that rely on a Sonarqube as their central platform for quality metrics would like to have all the
information in one place, in a addition to professional support.

Q: Isn't the price a bit high?
---
A: No. Consider writing the plugin yourself - which is possible, it's no rocket science - and the time you'd spent 
for that. On top of that, the time you need for helping yourself vs. getting support. We'd like to develop the plugin
further and even more support the community with contribution to the community plugin and the Pitest tool. 

Q: Can I use both community and commercial plugin?
---
A: Yes. They do not interfere with each other. But you get no added value from that, as the functionality of the 
community plugin is fully coved by the commercial plugin.
