== Installation

=== From binary

PerfTest is distributed as a binary build archive
from https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test/releases[GitHub releases] and
https://bintray.com/rabbitmq/java-tools/perf-test[Bintray] as well.

It is also available on
https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.rabbitmq%22%20AND%20a%3A%22perf-test%22[Maven Central]
if one needs to use it as library.

Milestone releases or release candidates are available in our
https://bintray.com/rabbitmq/java-tools-milestones/perf-test[Java Tools milestones repository]
and in
https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test/releases[GitHub releases] as well.


The distribution contains a script (`bin/runjava` or `bin/runjava.bat`)
to run Java with the class path correctly configured, e.g.
`bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest` runs
the `PerfTest` Java class.

To verify a PerfTest installation, use:

 $ bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --help

=== For Cloud Foundry

There is a https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test-for-cf[template project]
to easily run PerfTest on https://www.cloudfoundry.org/[Cloud Foundry].
