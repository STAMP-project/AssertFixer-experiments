jms-streamed-client example

This example is meant to be used the view messages put in a jms queue by the
Streamed API.

To use this example, you must first update the jndi.properties so it points to
the datawave-query instance you want to hit.  Modify the
'java.naming.provider.url' property of the jndi.properties file found in
src/main/resources.

Then build the project by running

mvn clean package

At that point, you can use the provided script to run the project.  From the
command line run the following

./bin/run.sh

This will launch the client and ask you to input the stream name.  

Use the -h option on run.sh to get more info.  You can attach a remote debugger if you would
like to step through the client
