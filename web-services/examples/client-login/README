client-login example

This project contains two examples, both dealing with an unsecured client 
calling a secured EJB.

1. datawave.webservice.examples.ClientLoginExampleBean is a timer bean that 
   calls a secured EJB once a minute and prints the effective authorizations
   of the user running JBoss (assuming it is a valid sid).  To run this
   example, simply drop client-login.jar into your jboss deploy directory.

2. datawave.webservice.examples.RemoteClientLoginExample is a standalone EJB
   client that calls a secured EJB and prints effective authorizations.  To
   run this example, execute the run.sh script in the same directory as this
   README.
