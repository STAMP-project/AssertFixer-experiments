 * <ol>
 * <li>Obtain an instance of this interface via the {@link MessagingChannel#newBroadcast(Object)} method call</li>
 * <li>Set options (f.e. {@link #withConfirmReceive(boolean) confirmation mode} or {@link #withAffinity(Object) affinity key})</li>
 * <li>Execute this operation via the {@link #submit()} method</li>
 * <li>Await for the execution result, if needed</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h3>Example:</h3>
 * ${source: messaging/MessagingServiceJavadocTest.java#broadcast_operation}
 *
 * @param <T> Message type.
