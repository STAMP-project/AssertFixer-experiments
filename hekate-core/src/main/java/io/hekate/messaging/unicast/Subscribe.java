 * <li>Obtain an instance of this interface via the {@link MessagingChannel#newSubscribe(Object)} call</li>
 * <li>Set options (f.e. {@link #withAffinity(Object) affinity key})</li>
 * <li>Execute this operation via the {@link #execute(ResponseCallback)}  method</li>
 * <li>Await for the execution result, if needed</li>
