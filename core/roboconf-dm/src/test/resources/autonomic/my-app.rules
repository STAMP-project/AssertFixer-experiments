# When "event-1" is triggered, replicate a service.
# The service is instantiated given the path on the next line.
# Each path segment designates a component name. Here, it means we will create...
# ... a new VM, with a new Tomcat, with a new instance of War 1.

# FIXME: we should be able to specify several instances here.

# When "event-2" is triggered, delete a service.
# The service to delete is associated with the component described on the next line (war1).
# The entire VM will be deleted. Only VM that were created with "Replicate-Service" can be
# deleted by "Delete-Service".
