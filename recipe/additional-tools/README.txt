As extra tools, we used checkstyle and javadoc generator plugins in maven as the pictures show it too.
Google Checks checkstyle is activated for the project, it gives warnings in the code, where the conventions are not kept - as shown on the image.
The javadoc is generated by maven when the mvn javadoc:javadoc command is given in command promt in the project directory.
The generated HTML javadoc can be found in the project's target/site/apidocs directory.
