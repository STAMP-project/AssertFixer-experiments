Ingesting MediaWiki dumps (wikipedia) into Accumulo with DATAWAVE
=================================================================

0. Set up Hadoop, ZooKeeper, Accumulo and Datawave. This may be difficult depending on your level of experience, but this is not the documentation to help you with this.

1. Download some wikipedia dumps (or you can use the sample file in src/test/resources/input) and put it in HDFS (preferrably uncompressed for splitting of mappers)
	For example: hdfs dfs -put *.xml ${HDFS_BASE_DIR}/wikipedia

2. If they don't already exist, you need to create the following files:
     ~/.m2/datawave/properties/{your-environment}-passwords.properties
     ~/.m2/datawave/properties/{your-environment}.properties

3. In your properties file configure the following parameters

    1. Add the wikipedia data type to one of the ingest data types properties (*INGEST_DATA_TYPES)
    	For example: LIVE_INGEST_DATA_TYPES=wikipedia
    	
    2. Set the flag maker property:
    	FLAG_MAKER_CONFIG=${DATAWAVE_INGEST_HOME}/config/WikipediaFlagMakerConfig.xml

4. Check over the configuration files to make sure the desired values and properties are set:
	-  ./warehouse/configuration-core/src/main/resources/config/wikipedia-config.xml
	-  ./warehouse/configuration-core/src/main/resources/config/WikipediaFlagMakerConfig.xml
    
5. Build DATWAVE: `mvn package -Passemble`

6. Follow the general DATAWAVE README for deploying from this step.

7. Ensure your wikipedia data is in HDFS in `${HDFS_BASE_DIR}/wikipedia`, uncompressed for those really large files (so you get more than one mapper).

8. Run ${DATAWAVE_INGEST_HOME}/bin/system/start-ingest.sh

9. Watch for mapreduce jobs to launch on the job tracker page.
