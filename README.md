### Used data and software

Internally, Lemming is using the [Grph library](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~hogie/software/index.php).

For testing, we are using the [email-Eu-core network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core.html) published by the Stanford University. It has been transformed into a simple RDF file.
